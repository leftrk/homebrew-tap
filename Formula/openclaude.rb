  # Built from the leftrk fork (carries local fixes, e.g. the auto-compact
  # message-count gate). The url/sha256/version fields below are maintained
  # automatically by leftrk/openclaude's homebrew-tap.yml workflow on every
  # pushed v* tag; it also drops the stale bottle block and dispatches a
  # bottle rebuild (bottle.yml re-adds fresh hashes). Edit by hand only for
  # emergencies.
